				My Journey at DEPT ‚Äî From Junior to Senior and Beyond
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				Let‚Äôs kick things off with a little bit about DEPT. DEPT is a global
				digital agency offering cutting-edge technical and creative services to
				a wide range of clients‚Äîfrom household names to ambitious startups. It‚Äôs
				fast-paced, dynamic, and packed with opportunities to learn and grow.
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				I spent about 2.5 years at DEPT, and in that time, I got to work with an
				incredible variety of technologies and teams. It was the kind of place
				where every project felt like a fresh challenge‚Äîand I thrived in that
				environment.
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="h3" visual="h3">
				The Squad Setup
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				Each project team (or "squad") was uniquely formed, which kept things
				interesting. Typically, a squad would consist of:
			</Typography>
			<ul>
				<li>1 Tech Lead</li>
				<li>2 Mid-level devs (or 1 Mid + 1 Junior)</li>
				<li>1 Designer</li>
				<li>1 Backend Developer</li>
				<li>1 Project Manager</li>
			</ul>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				This flexible, collaborative structure gave me exposure to different
				ways of working and allowed me to learn from a wide range of people.
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="h3" visual="h3">
				Leveling Up
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				When I joined DEPT, I started as a Junior Frontend Developer. But in
				just two and a half years, I climbed the ranks to Senior Developer. The
				key? A mix of passion, consistency, and a borderline-obsessive desire to
				improve. I spent time inside and outside of work learning,
				experimenting, and refining my craft‚Äîalways aiming to deliver the best
				possible output for both our clients and the agency.
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="h3" visual="h3">
				Project Highlights
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				Over the years, I contributed to a bunch of exciting projects. Some of
				the more notable names include:
			</Typography>
			<ul>
				<li>Harwoods</li>
				<li>St. James‚Äôs Place</li>
				<li>GEA</li>
				<li>Triumph Motorcycles</li>
				<li>CO-OP Live</li>
			</ul>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				The work was fast-paced. Delivery deadlines were tight, and we were
				expected to ship clean, tested, scalable code that perfectly matched the
				designs. It was intense‚Äîbut it taught me how to balance speed with
				quality.
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="h3" visual="h3">
				Tech Stack & Accessibility Advocacy
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				My primary toolkit at DEPT included:
			</Typography>
			<ul>
				<li>React</li>
				<li>Typescript</li>
				<li>Next.js</li>
				<li>Storybook</li>
				<li>Styled Components</li>
			</ul>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				It was also at DEPT that my passion for accessibility (a11y) truly took
				root. I noticed that many frontend devs had little understanding of how
				to build accessible interfaces‚Äîand I made it my mission to change that,
				starting with myself. To this day, I‚Äôm always learning and pushing for
				more inclusive digital experiences.
			</Typography>

			<Typography as="h3" visual="h3">
				A Deep Dive: Harwoods
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				One of my favorite projects at DEPT was the build for Harwoods.
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				This was a large-scale project built from the ground up. Although I
				wasn‚Äôt involved in the initial discovery sessions, I quickly became
				familiar with the architectural landscape of the site.
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				Here‚Äôs a simplified view of how things were structured: CMS-managed
				content + layout ‚Üí Salesforce ‚Üí Proxy Gateway ‚Üí Website
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				The site was designed to be highly customizable through a CMS‚Äîmost
				likely Contentful (if memory serves)‚Äîwhich allowed the client to manage
				key pages and content dynamically. These content layers were then
				enriched via Salesforce through a proxy gateway, ensuring the site
				displayed relevant and real-time data.
			</Typography>
			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				DEPT was a defining chapter in my career. It shaped me not only as a
				developer but also as a team player, mentor, and advocate for
				accessibility. I'm proud of the work I did there and excited for what
				comes next.

				üöß Reshaping the Frontend Architecture
			</Typography>

			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				When I joined, one of my first major initiatives was helping restructure
				the frontend codebase. The goal was clear: improve scalability, reduce

			</Typography>

			<Typography as="p" visual="p">
				This meant diving into:
			</Typography>
			<ul>
